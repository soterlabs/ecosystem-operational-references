## Introduction

### Goal of this update

Deploy five Morpho Vault V2 instances operated by the sky.money curator on Ethereum mainnet, allowing users to deposit stablecoins (USDS, USDC, USDT) and earn yield through lending on Morpho Blue markets collateralized by Sky ecosystem assets (stUSDS, sUSDS) and blue-chip crypto assets (cbBTC, wstETH, WETH).

### Required context

- These deployments were carried out by Soter Labs on behalf of the Prime Agent [Skybase](https://forum.skyeco.com/t/technical-scope-of-the-new-skybase-agent/27642)
- The sky.money curator is controlled by Skybase
- All vaults, adapters, and oracles were deployed using Morpho's official factory contracts (VaultV2Factory, AdapterFactory, OracleFactory)
- Canonical factory addresses: https://docs.morpho.org/get-started/resources/addresses/#morpho-v2-contracts
- All deployment scripts, tests, and configurations are open-source: https://github.com/soterlabs/morpho-vault-v2-deployment

### The reason(s) behind this update

**[ADDED]** Skybase expansion into new markets.

### Timing of this update (in stages, if needed)

All vault deployments were already performed.

## Relevant audits

**[ADDED]** All listed contracts were deployed via Morpho's official factory contracts. No contract was directly deployed by a deployer.

## Pre-configurations
**[ADDED]** No additional pre-configurations were made by the deployer.

## Pre-requirements
**[ADDED]** No specific pre-requirements.

## Proposed actions
**[ADDED]** Announce the deployments to users.

## Post-checks

1. **[ADDED]** Ensure the correctness of the scripts
    - What will be done: Run deployment scripts in-memory on an Anvil fork. Verify scripts produce correct vault configuration, oracle parameters, market creation, and deposit/withdraw operations.
    - How it will be done: By a script located in: [morpho-vault-v2-deployment/test](https://github.com/soterlabs/morpho-vault-v2-deployment/tree/393f3a640fef8795927c0f8011d71025dcd83e5e/test) (pattern: `vault_name/DeployVaultNameScript.t.sol`)
    - Expected outcome: No errors.
    - Who will perform this action: The deployer.

2. **[ADDED]** Ensure the correctness of the deployed contracts
    - What will be done: Run against already-deployed contracts on mainnet (pinned to deployment block)
    - How it will be done: Modify and run a test in: [morpho-vault-v2-deployment/test](https://github.com/soterlabs/morpho-vault-v2-deployment/tree/393f3a640fef8795927c0f8011d71025dcd83e5e/test) (pattern: `vault_name/DeployedVaultNameVault.t.sol`)
    - Expected outcome: on-chain state matches expected configuration
    - Who will perform this action: The deployer.

## Technical risk self-assessment

1. **ERC4626 Inflation Attack: Share manipulation attacks on ERC4626 vaults**
    - Applied mitigations: Each vault is initialized with a "dead deposit":
        - 18-decimal vaults (USDS): 1e18 (1 USDS)
        - 6-decimal vaults (USDC, USDT): 1e6 (1 USDC/USDT)

2. **IRM Convergence Risk: Adaptive IRM may not converge to reasonable rates quickly without initial utilization**
    - Risk description: Adaptive IRM may not converge to reasonable rates quickly without initial utilization
    - Applied mitigations: Single-market vaults bootstrap 90% market utilization via dead collateral + borrow

3. **Runaway Interest Rates: Interest rates could spike to extremely high levels**
    - Applied mitigations: All markets use `MAX_RATE = 63419583967` (~200% APR) cap

4. **USDT Non-Standard Approval: USDT's `approve()` function does not return a boolean, which could cause transaction failures**
    - Applied mitigations: All USDT interactions use OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20.forceApprove()`

5. **Manual allocation could lead to suboptimal capital deployment (USDS Flagship only)**
    - Applied mitigations:
        - Allocation caps: 20% max to the adapter (aggregate), 5% max per individual market
        - Allocator bot via Safe 1/3 multisig

## Emergency actions

1. **Sentinel role can revoke pending actions**
    - When to do: When pending time-locked actions need to be revoked, or emergency intervention is required
    - How to do it: Sentinel msig ([`0x3F32bC09d41eE699844F8296e806417D6bf61Bba`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3F32bC09d41eE699844F8296e806417D6bf61Bba)) can revoke pending actions by calling **[SKIPPED]**

## Research and additional notes

### Single-Market Vaults (Risk Capital + USDT Savings)

```mermaid
graph LR
    User -->|deposit| VaultV2["VaultV2 - ERC4626"]
    VaultV2 -->|auto-allocate| Adapter["MorphoMarketV1AdapterV2"]
    Adapter -->|supply| Morpho["Morpho Blue Market"]
```

- **VaultV2**: ERC4626-compliant vault created via `VaultV2Factory`
- **MorphoMarketV1AdapterV2**: Connects the vault to a single Morpho Blue market
- **Liquidity Adapter**: Set on the vault so deposits are automatically allocated to the lending market

### USDS Flagship Vault (Multi-Market, Manual Allocation)

```mermaid
graph LR
    User -->|deposit| Vault["VaultV2 (ERC4626)"]

        M2["wstETH / USDS"]

        M4["stUSDS / USDS"]
    end

    Adapter -->|supply| M1
    Adapter -->|supply| M2
    Adapter -->|supply| M3
    Adapter -->|supply| M4
```

- **No liquidity adapter**: The vault does **not** auto-allocate. Capital allocation is managed manually.
- **4 markets**: stUSDS/USDS, cbBTC/USDS, wstETH/USDS, WETH/USDS (all 86% LLTV)
- **Allocator bot**: A TypeScript bot allocates capital via a Safe 1/3 multisig (threshold=1), where the bot is one of the 3 signers. Transactions are routed through Safe's `execTransaction`.
